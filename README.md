# Python Code Snippets
Useful code snippets I find that I would like to make a note of for future use in projects.

The first folder will be a collection of all the graphs I have used so far on my course. I'm especially excited for some of the [lets-plot](https://lets-plot.org/)
stuff I have worked on recently.
